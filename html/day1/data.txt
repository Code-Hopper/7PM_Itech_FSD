structure of a website/web page is created using HTML

HTML(Hyper Text Markup language) is programming language.
we can create web page/s

we need a simple text editor to write html code, to see the output of the html code we will need a web browser

step 1: create .html page 
step 2: open the page using any web browser (our OS sees the .html file as web file by default it will be opened in any web browser)

step 3: syntax for writing a html page

html creates page/s using elements
text elements (heading, span, paragraphs),
text style elements(bold, super-script),
media element,
tabular element(lists and tables),
input element, etc.

to create a html element we need a html tag

there are 3 types of html tags 
container tag
<tagname>some content</tagname>
opening tag - closing tag

self-closing tag
<tagname attr="" />

empty tag
<tagname />

comments - are the code which won't get executed

<!-- html tag is also called as root element or tag -->
	<head>
	<!-- logics, rules, relations, meta-data -->
	</head>
	
	<body>
	<!-- content to displayed  -->
	</body>
</html>
